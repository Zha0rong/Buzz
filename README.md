## What is MERFISHer?

MERFISH is a Spatial Single Cell Transcriptome capturing technology<sup>[1](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/50/14456)</sup>. It not only generates the single cell transcriptome like other single cell technology (not exactly but anyway), but also generates the locations of every cell and every transcript. The figure below is from the analysis results of one of the dataset publically available online<sup>[2](https://zenodo.org/record/5512749#.Yd2eHdHMKUk)</sup>.
